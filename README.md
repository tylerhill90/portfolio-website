# Portfolio Website

This portfolio website showcases myself along with my coding projects. It uses a python Flask framework and the [template](./templates/index.html) was provided freely by [BootstrapMade.com](https://bootstrapmade.com/iportfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-websites-template/) It is hosted on Heroku.
